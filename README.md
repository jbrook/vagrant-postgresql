vagrant-postgresql
==================

Setup a PostgreSQL 9.2 synchronous replication playground with vagrant and chef

Use a new version of vagrant - use the downloadable installer instead of the version that can be installed with gem.
I used 1.2.2 - http://downloads.vagrantup.com

Set up Bekshelf and install the Berkshelf plugin as described here: http://berkshelf.com
